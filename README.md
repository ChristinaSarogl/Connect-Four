# Connect Four

This repository contains the implementation of the Connect-Four game, using the Minimax algorithm. 

The Seven Six Puzzle Game is a two-player, perfect information, zero-sum game. Its main component is a seven-by-six board into which the players can place their tokens. Tokens are placed into the first empty space within a column, starting from the bottom. The goal of the game for each player is to create a sequence of 4 of their tokens horizontally, vertically, diagonally, or anti-diagonally. The first player to achieve this is the winner. The tokens for the MAX player are usually denoted using an “X”, and the tokens for the MIN player are usually denoted using an “O”.

The program uses the console to interact with the user, however some GUI is planned to be added in the future the improve the overall experience.
